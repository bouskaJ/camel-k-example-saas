# Camel K SaaS Example
 
![Camel K CI](https://github.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-saas/workflows/Camel%20K%20CI/badge.svg)

This example demonstrates how to use Camel K to integrate Salesforce and Workday, two popular SaaS providers. It requires a Salesforce login credentials to run the demo. It also includes a mock Workday integration, in case you do not have a Workday account. Note that if you use an actual Workday account, you must modify the example to use your credentials and SOAP connection URL. 

## Before you begin

Make sure you check-out this repository from git and open it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Instructions are based on [VSCode Didact](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-didact), so make sure it's installed
from the VSCode extensions marketplace.

From the VSCode UI, right-click on the `readme.didact.md` file and select "Didact: Start Didact tutorial from File". A new Didact tab will be opened in VS Code.

Make sure you've opened this readme file with Didact before jumping to the next section.

## Preparing the cluster

This example can be run on any OpenShift 4.3+ cluster or a local development instance (such as [CRC](https://github.com/code-ready/crc)). Ensure that you have a cluster available and login to it using the OpenShift `oc` command line tool.

You need to create a new project named `camel-saas` for running this example. This can be done directly from the OpenShift web console or by executing the command `oc new-project camel-saas` on a terminal window.

You need to install the Camel K operator in the `camel-saas` project. To do so, go to the OpenShift 4.x web console, login with a cluster admin account and use the OperatorHub menu item on the left to find and install **"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"**. You will be given the option to install it globally on the cluster or on a specific namespace.
If using a specific namespace, make sure you select the `camel-saas` project from the dropdown list.
This completes the installation of the Camel K operator (it may take a couple of minutes).

When the operator is installed, from the OpenShift Help menu ("?") at the top of the WebConsole, you can access the "Command Line Tools" page, where you can download the **"kamel"** CLI, that is required for running this example. The CLI must be installed in your system path.

Refer to the **"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"** documentation for a more detailed explanation of the installation steps for the operator and the CLI.

You can use the following section to check if your environment is configured properly.

## Checking requirements

<a href='didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.validateAllRequirements' title='Validate all requirements!'><button>Validate all Requirements at Once!</button></a>

**OpenShift CLI ("oc")**

The OpenShift CLI tool ("oc") will be used to interact with the OpenShift cluster.

[Check if the OpenShift CLI ("oc") is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.cliCommandSuccessful&text=oc-requirements-status$$oc%20help&completion=Checked%20oc%20tool%20availability "Tests to see if `oc help` returns a 0 return code"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#oc-requirements-status}


**Connection to an OpenShift cluster**

You need to connect to an OpenShift cluster in order to run the examples.

[Check if you're connected to an OpenShift cluster](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.requirementCheck&text=cluster-requirements-status$$oc%20get%20project$$NAME&completion=OpenShift%20is%20connected. "Tests to see if `kamel version` returns a result"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#cluster-requirements-status}

**Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel")**

Apart from the support provided by the VS Code extension, you also need the Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel") in order to 
access all Camel K features.

[Check if the Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel") is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.requirementCheck&text=kamel-requirements-status$$kamel%20version$$Camel%20K%20Client&completion=Apache%20Camel%20K%20CLI%20is%20available%20on%20this%20system. "Tests to see if `kamel version` returns a result"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#kamel-requirements-status}

### Optional Requirements

The following requirements are optional. They don't prevent the execution of the demo, but may make it easier to follow.

**VS Code Extension Pack for Apache Camel**

The VS Code Extension Pack for Apache Camel by Red Hat provides a collection of useful tools for Apache Camel K developers,
such as code completion and integrated lifecycle management. They are **recommended** for the tutorial, but they are **not**
required.

You can install it from the VS Code Extensions marketplace.

[Check if the VS Code Extension Pack for Apache Camel by Red Hat is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.extensionRequirementCheck&text=extension-requirement-status$$redhat.apache-camel-extension-pack&completion=Camel%20extension%20pack%20is%20available%20on%20this%20system. "Checks the VS Code workspace to make sure the extension pack is installed"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#extension-requirement-status}

## 1. Preparing the project

We'll connect to the `camel-saas` project and check the installation status.

To change project, open a terminal tab and type the following command:

```
oc project camel-saas
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20project%20camel-saas&completion=New%20project%20creation. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

We should now check that the operator is installed. To do so, execute the following command on a terminal:

Upon successful creation, you should ensure that the Camel K operator is installed:

```
oc get csv
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20csv&completion=Checking%20Cluster%20Service%20Versions. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

When Camel K is installed, you should find an entry related to `red-hat-camel-k-operator` in phase `Succeeded`.

You can now proceed to the next section.

## 2. Mock Workday Integration

> **NOTE:** This step is only needed if you don't have an actual Workday instance to test. 
> If you have a running Workday test instance, skip to [SaaS integration](##-3-saas-integration).

The mock Workday integration creates a SOAP endpoint as a cluster service called `mock-workday`. This service name is used in the SaaS integration secrets to connect to the mock Workday integration. 

### 2.1. Creating a Kubernetes Secret for mock Workday credentials

If you are using the mock Workday integration, this repository contains a simple [mock-secret-saas.properties](didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=mock-secret-saas.properties&completion=Opened%20the%mock-secret-saas.properties%20file "Opens the mock-secret-saas.properties file"){.didact} that can be used to generate a Kubernetes Secret with the mock Workday credentials by providing values for the properties in the file. 

```
oc create secret generic mock-secret-saas --from-file=mock-secret-saas.properties
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=mockCamelTerm$$oc%20create%20secret%20generic%20mock-secret-saas%20--from-file%3Dmock-secret-saas.properties&completion=secret%20%22mock-secret-saas%22%20created. "Create a secret with mock Workday credentials"){.didact})

### 2.2. Running the mock Workday service

The mock Workday integration creates a Workday SOAP service for the [Revenue Management WSDL Put Customer Request](https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/productionapi/Revenue_Management/v34.2/Put_Customer_Request.html) operation that generates a random UUID Workday `Customer_Request_Reference ID`. 

The integration is contained in the file [MockWorkday.java](didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=MockWorkday.java&completion=Opened%20the%20MockWorkday.java%20file "Opens the MockWorkday.java file"){.didact}.

> **NOTE:** The `MockWorkday.java` file contains a simple integration that uses the `cxf` component.
> Dependency management is automatically handled by Camel K that imports all required libraries from the Camel
> catalog via code inspection. This means you can use all 300+ Camel components directly in your routes.
> But for the Workday connection, some external CXF runtime and WS-Security dependencies are required. 
> These are easily added using the Camel K modeline at the top of the file. 

We're ready to run the mock Workday service on our `camel-saas` project in the cluster.

Use the following command to run it in "dev mode", in order to see the logs in the integration terminal:

```
kamel run MockWorkday.java --dev
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=mockCamelTerm$$kamel%20run%20MockWorkday.java%20--dev&completion=Camel%20K%20mock%20Workday%20service%20run%20in%20dev%20mode. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

If everything is ok, after the build phase finishes, you should see the Camel integration `mock-workday` running.

To keep the integration running and not linked to the terminal, you can run it without "dev mode", just run:

```
kamel run MockWorkday.java
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=mockCamelTerm$$kamel%20run%20MockWorkday.java&completion=Camel%20K%20mock%20Workday%20service%20run%20in%20dev%20mode. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

After executing the command, you should be able to see it among running integrations:

```
oc get integrations
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=mockCamelTerm$$oc%20get%20integrations&completion=Getting%20running%20integrations. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

An integration named `mock-workday` should be present in the list and it should be in status `Running`. There's also a `kamel get` command which is an alternative way to list all running integrations.

> **Note:** the first time you've run the integration, an IntegrationKit (basically, a container image) has been created for it and 
> it took some time for this phase to finish. When you run the integration a second time, the existing IntegrationKit is reused 
> (if possible) and the integration reaches the "Running" state much faster.

Even if it's not running in dev mode, you can still see the logs of the integration using the following command:

```
kamel log mock-workday
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=mockCamelTerm$$kamel%20log%20mock-workday&completion=Show%20integration%20logs. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

The last parameter ("mock-workday") is the name of the running integration for which you want to display the logs.

After running the SaaS integration in the next section, you may [**click here to terminate the log stream**](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalCtrlC&text=mockCamelTerm&completion=Camel%20K%mock-workday%20integration%20interrupted. "Interrupt the current operation on the terminal"){.didact} 
or hit `ctrl+c` on the terminal window to terminate the `mock-workday` integration running in dev mode.

> **Note:** Your IDE may provide an "Apache Camel K Integrations" panel where you can see the list of running integrations and also open a window to display the logs.

## 3. SaaS integration

This repository contains a Camel K integration that subscribes to new Salesforce Account creation notifications and maps the event data to submit a new Customer request in Workday. It also adds the new Workday Customer `ID` as the `Account Number` field in the Salesforce Account. 

### 3.1. Creating a Kubernetes Secret from Salesforce and Workday credentials

This repository contains a simple [secret-saas.properties](didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=secret-saas.properties&completion=Opened%20the%secret-saas.properties%20file "Opens the secret-saas.properties file"){.didact} that can be used to generate a Kubernetes Secret with the Salesforce and Workday credentials. If you are using the `mock-workday` integration, set the service URL as follows

```
workday-url=http://mock-workday/services/workday
```

After property values have been added to `secret-saas.properties`, create the secret using the command:

```
oc create secret generic secret-saas --from-file=secret-saas.properties
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20create%20secret%20generic%20secret-saas%20--from-file%3Dsecret-saas.properties&completion=secret%20%22secret-saas%22%20created. "Create a secret with Salesforce and Workday credentials"){.didact})

### 3.2. Running SaaS integration

The integration is all contained in a single file named `SalesforceToWorkday.java` ([open](didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=SalesforceToWorkday.java&completion=Opened%20the%20SalesforceToWorkday.java%20file "Opens the SalesforceToWorkday.java file"){.didact}).

> **Note:** the `SalesforceToWorkday.java` file contains a simple integration that uses the `salesforce` and `cxf` components.
> Dependency management is automatically handled by Camel K that imports all required libraries from the Camel
> catalog via code inspection. This means you can use all 300+ Camel components directly in your routes.
> But for the Workday connection, some external CXF runtime and WS-Security dependencies are required. 
> These are easily added using the `-d` parameter of the ``kamel run` command. 

We're ready to run the integration on our `camel-saas` project in the cluster.

Use the following command to run it in "dev mode", in order to see the logs in the integration terminal:

```
kamel run SalesforceToWorkday.java --dev
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20SalesforceToWorkday.java%20--dev&completion=Camel%20K%20saas%20integration%20run%20in%20dev%20mode. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

If everything is ok, after the build phase finishes, you should see the Camel integration running. When a new Salesforce Account is created, the integration will print "New Account <salesforce-id>" in the terminal window. After creating a Workday Customer Request it will print "Created Customer with id <workday-customer-id>". It will then update the Salesforce Account and print "Updated Account with Customer id <workday-customer-id>". 

When running in dev mode, you can change the integration code and let Camel K redeploy the changes automatically.

To try this feature,
[open the `SalesforceToWorkday.java` file](didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=SalesforceToWorkday.java&completion=Opened%20the%20SalesforceToWorkday.java%20file "Opens the SalesforceToWorkday.java file"){.didact} 
and change "New Account" to "Holy new Account Batman", then save the file.
You should see the new integration starting up in the terminal window and replacing the old one.

[**To exit dev mode and terminate the execution**, just click here](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalCtrlC&text=camelTerm&completion=Camel%20K%20saas%20integration%20interrupted. "Interrupt the current operation on the terminal"){.didact} 
or hit `ctrl+c` on the terminal window.

> **Note:** When you terminate a "dev mode" execution, also the remote integration will be deleted. This gives the experience of a local program execution, but the integration is actually running in the remote cluster.

To keep the integration running and not linked to the terminal, you can run it without "dev mode", just run:

```
kamel run SalesforceToWorkday.java
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20SalesforceToWorkday.java&completion=Camel%20K%20saas%20integration%20run. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

After executing the command, you should be able to see it among running integrations:

```
oc get integrations
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20integrations&completion=Getting%20running%20integrations. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

An integration named `salesforce-to-workday` should be present in the list and it should be in status `Running`. There's also a `kamel get` command which is an alternative way to list all running integrations.

> **Note:** the first time you've run the integration, an IntegrationKit (basically, a container image) has been created for it and 
> it took some time for this phase to finish. When you run the integration a second time, the existing IntegrationKit is reused 
> (if possible) and the integration reaches the "Running" state much faster.
>

Even if it's not running in dev mode, you can still see the logs of the integration using the following command:

```
kamel log salesforce-to-workday
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20log%20salesforce-to-workday&completion=Show%20integration%20logs. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

The last parameter ("salesforce-to-workday") is the name of the running integration for which you want to display the logs.

[**Click here to terminate the log stream**](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalCtrlC&text=camelTerm&completion=Camel%20K%20salesforce-to-workday%20integration%20interrupted. "Interrupt the current operation on the terminal"){.didact} 
or hit `ctrl+c` on the terminal window.

> **Note:** Your IDE may provide an "Apache Camel K Integrations" panel where you can see the list of running integrations and also open a window to display the logs.

## 4. Uninstall

To cleanup everything, execute the following command:

```oc delete project camel-saas```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20delete%20project%20camel-saas&completion=Removed%20the%20project%20from%20the%20cluster. "Cleans up the cluster after running the example"){.didact})
